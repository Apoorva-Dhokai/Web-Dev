     <!-- Entities -->
     <!-- used when some text collides the syntax of the HTML -->
      3 > 4 [no problem it will print as it is]
      this is example of entities <p></p>     [Here the <p></p> will not be printed because for html it is the syntax of paragraph tag]
      
      so to avoid this we use Entities
      <p> is written as &lt;p&gt; in entities
      &nbsp; is used to have spaces in between lines

    <pre>
        this is used to show exact output as written



        it will print this line as it is after 4-5 spaces
